## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Type a task into the input field.
2. Click **"Add"** to insert it into your to-do list.
3. Check the checkbox to mark as completed — the label gets a line-through.
4. Click ❌ to delete the task.
5. All data is stored in `localStorage`, so tasks stay even if you reload.

## 📲 Responsive Design

The app is mobile-friendly and adjusts layout for smaller screens using CSS media queries.
